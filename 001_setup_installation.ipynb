    "\n",
    "A virtual environment allows you to isolate and manage Python packages for different projects. Here's how to create a virtual environment using the built-in `venv` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open a Terminal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - On Windows, open the Command Prompt.\n",
    "  - On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - On Windows:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python -m venv myenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - On macOS and Linux:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python3 -m venv myenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Replace `myenv` with your preferred name for the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:\n",
    "- On Windows:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- On macOS and Linux:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  source myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- After activation, you'll see the name of the virtual environment in the command prompt (e.g., `(myenv)`).\n",

    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning library developed by Google. Here's how to install and set up TensorFlow in a Python environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Tensorflow and Work in the Virtual Environment**:\n",
    "- Once the virtual environment is activated, install tensorflow using `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  pip install tensorflow\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "2. **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "- After installation, you can verify that TensorFlow is properly installed by starting a Python interpreter and importing   TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "  print(tf.__version__)\n",
